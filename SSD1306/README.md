HOW TO SETUP:

1. Change SSID and PASSWORD in wificfg.py
2. Save 'wificfg.py' to Pico
3. Save ssd1306.py to Pico
4. Save 'main.py' to Pico
5. Restart Pico and hopefully everything should work fine!

Super simple to setup.

P.S The display will scroll through start time, IP address and client IP every 5 seconds instead of all displaying at once on the lcd due to space limitations.
